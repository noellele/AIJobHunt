## RSS feed

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) – is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format

Most of the jobs are for people from the Americas (USA, Canada and LATAM) and Europe/EMEA. Keep this in mind if your main audience is from other regions. You can find our public [RSS](https://jobicy.com/feed/job_feed) feed here for all jobs posted:

## RSS feed generator

  
  

RSS Jobicy – This interface allows information to be received from the database jobicy.com. You do not need to know in detail how the base is constructed and from which table and field types it consists of. It is enough that API-request “knows” it. The request syntax and the type of data being returned are strictly determined by the service itself.

With this RSS, now you can build job apps with our data feed. Listings of jobs can be derived from the following endpoints:

`**RSS Query Parameters**    **/feed/job_feed** (required)   **&job_categories=...** (business, copywriting, healthcare, education, legal, admin-support, supporting, data-science, design-multimedia, admin, accounting-finance, hr, marketing, management, dev, seller, seo, smm, engineering, technical-suppor, web-app-design)   **&job_types=...** (full-time, freelance, contract, part-time)   **&search_keywords=...** (eg. designer)   **&search_region=...** (apac, emea, latam, argentina, australia, austria, belgium, brazil, bulgaria, canada, china, hong-kong, costa-rica, croatia, cyprus, czechia, denmark, estonia, europe, finland, france, germany, greece, hungary, ireland, israel, italy, japan, latvia, lithuania, mexico, netherlands, new-zealand, norway, philippines, poland, portugal, romania, serbia, singapore, slovakia, slovenia, south-korea, spain, sweden, switzerland, thailand, turkiye, united-arab-emirates, uk, ukraine, usa, vietnam)    `

Example query string:

Response: Full-time Customer Service jobs in the U.S. region.

## Fair Use and Restrictions

At Jobicy, we are thankful for your engagement with our feeds and would like to provide some guidelines to ensure the best use of our resources:

1. **Appreciation for Integration**: We are grateful for your incorporation of Jobicy Feeds into your projects.
2. **Primary Purpose of API/RSS/XML Access**: Access to these feeds is primarily intended to facilitate the wider distribution of our job listings.
3. **Distribution Limitations**: We request that our job listings not be distributed to external job platforms such as Jooble, Google Jobs, LinkedIn, and others.
4. **Publication Timing**: To maintain our position as the original source, our job postings are intentionally published with a 6-hour delay.
5. **Access Frequency**: Frequent polling for job data is unnecessary. Accessing the Feed a few times a day is sufficient, as our job information does not change more rapidly than this.
6. **Excessive Querying**: Please be aware that excessive querying of our Feed may lead to restricted access.

We may implement restrictive measures and notify you and/or your service provider if:

- you intentionally overload feeds (please limit feed checks to no more than once per hour);
- you alter or misrepresent the content of the original response during import;
- we determine that your actions are interfering with the functionality of our systems.

We appreciate your cooperation and adherence to these guidelines to ensure a beneficial partnership.
