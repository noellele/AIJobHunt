We reach first for battle-tested, well-supported technologies that allow us to deliver business value quickly and ensure reliability for the patients and clinicians that depend on us. Our engineers take pride in solutions that are built to last and simple to maintain.Mindful Innovation: As technical experts, we must lead the charge in uncovering opportunities for innovation and automation across our business. We encourage the use of emergent technologies when they provide a clear, measurable impact for our most pressing business problems. Our engineers are innovators who can justify their choices with expertise and professional wisdom.Extreme Ownership: Our engineers carry a deep sense of personal accountability for everything they ship. We arenât satisfied with just completing the requirements in a ticket; we partner with stakeholders and dive deeply into business problems to ensure we are building the right thing, often identifying gaps in requirements well before they become problems in production. We view thorough documentation and rigorous self-testing of our code as non-negotiable parts of the jobânot for the sake of process, but because we refuse to leave the success of our work to chance.Business-Focused Engineering: We don't measure success by the frequency of releases or the number of tickets closed, but by the outcomes that we drive for our clinicians and patients. We expect every engineer on our team to possess a keen ""business sense""âto understand the why behind a request before diving into the how. It is our responsibility to develop a deep understanding of our stakeholdersâ pain points and proactively propose technical solutions that address them with accuracy.&nbsp;Simplicity over Complexity : We strive to write software that is simple, clear and approachable, allowing new engineers to open pull requests within their first week on the job. We are careful to avoid speculative abstractions, experimental design patterns, and other forms of over-engineering that make our systems difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.Please mention the word **ATTRACTIVE** and tag RNjguMTAxLjExNy4xNzI= when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RNjguMTAxLjExNy4xNzI=).
