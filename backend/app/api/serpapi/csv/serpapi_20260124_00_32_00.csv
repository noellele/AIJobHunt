You will work on a large, mature enterprise backend that powers student financial aid management for universities in the United States. The system runs in a strict regulatory environment and has deep, complex business logic. Your mission is to modernize the way we build and sustain this platform by introducing AI assisted practices that add real, measurable value—speed, quality, compliance, and maintainability—without compromising safety or reliability. What You’ll Do • Help define a roadmap for AI adoption across all phases of the software lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, observability, incident response). • Evaluate, pilot, and scale AI enabled tools (e.g., large language model code assistants, test case generation, performance tuning bots, security analysis agents). • Help set policies and guardrails for responsible AI usage. • Design and extend core services using Java 17+, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Helidon. • Refactor legacy components to be AI friendly (e.g., adding rich documentation, type safe APIs, modular boundaries). • Help the team in integrating AI assisted IDE extensions, pair programming bots, and code review assistants. • Assist with establishing best practice guidelines for when and how to rely on AI generated code, ensuring human validation and auditability. • Deploy AI driven test case generation, mutation testing, and automated exploratory testing. • Use AI to predict flaky tests, prioritize test execution, and automatically generate test data sets. • Incorporate AI powered pipeline optimizations (e.g., smart build caching, failure root cause analysis, deployment risk scoring). • Automate intelligent rollback decisions and anomaly detection using observability AI. • Foster a data driven, continuous learning culture where AI is seen as a collaborative teammate, not a replacement. • Work with Oracle Security teams to guarantee AI tooling respects data privacy, regulatory, and security constraints. • Conduct regular AI risk assessments and integrate findings into the software security assurance process. • Communicate effectively with product owners, architects, and senior stakeholders across time zones (Slack, Zoom, async docs). • Participate in Kanban ceremonies, code reviews, and architecture boards, bringing AI centric perspectives to each. Core Stack & Environment Languages & Frameworks: Java 17+, Spring Framework & Spring Boot, Hibernate, Helidon (plus exposure to emerging AI centric frameworks) Containers & Orchestration: Kubernetes (Helm, Operators) Databases: Oracle, MySQL (AI assisted query tuning, automated schema evolution) Build & Tooling: Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Jenkins (AI enhanced pipelines) Testing: JUnit, Cucumber/BDD, AI generated test scaffolding, mutation testing tools Collaboration: Remote first, globally distributed team, async workflow, strong emphasis on documentation What We’re Looking For • Java Mastery | 7+ years of production Java development, deep knowledge of the Spring ecosystem. • AI Tooling Savvy • Proven experience experimenting with LLM based code assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Claude, or internal Oracle AI tools). • Experience can be from personal projects, POCs, or enterprise pilots. • Systems Thinking • Ability to navigate large, legacy codebases and design modular, AI compatible components. • Regulated Domain Acumen • Familiarity with compliance heavy environments (e.g., FERPA, GDPR, financial data handling). • Leadership & Influence • Demonstrated mentorship, evangelism, and the ability to drive cross team adoption of new practices. • Strong Communication • Clear, concise English (written and spoken); capable of influencing senior stakeholders and remote teams. • Automation & DevOps • Experience with CI/CD pipelines; enthusiasm for AI driven automation in build, test, and release stages. • Quality Mindset • Passion for automated testing, code quality, and continuous improvement. • Curiosity & Pragmatism | Willingness to experiment with emerging AI tech but also the discipline to reject it when the ROI isn’t clear. • Formal AI expertise (e.g., ML research, data science) is not required—what matters is the ability to evaluate, adopt, and champion AI tools responsibly. If you’re a seasoned Java engineer who is excited about helping to lead the AI transformation of a mission critical enterprise platform—and you thrive in a collaborative, remote first environment—this is the role for you.

If that’s not something you want to commit to, you might be frustrated here. - If you dislike or have never tried pair programming, expect a steep learning curve. - If you need an in-office experience (and don’t live near our headquarters in San Francisco), MO might not be the best fit. - We offer opportunities for team and organization offsites. If you want zero travel for work, you may feel left out. - A lot of our teams have a customer-facing services component. It may be difficult to fully avoid that kind of work over time. - Most of the mainframe systems we work with have COBOL, which has a steep learning curve and many foreign concepts.

Roebling,Senior/Staff Software Engineer,Anywhere,Qualifications; Benefits; Responsibilities,"About Us We’re building Roebling, an AI-native industrial planning platform aimed at enabling the rapid development of the industrial infrastructure required to power and manufacture cutting edge technologies. Today, innovators face an outdated reality: getting to construction on projects big and small requires thousands of hours of repetitive, PDF- and spreadsheet-driven workflows with heavy QA/QC overhead. It’s inefficient, slow, and largely unchanged for more than a century. Over the past 18 months, we’ve built an MVP to demonstrate how reducing planning timelines by 10x helps companies bring new products to market faster. We’re not building another OpenAI wrapper – the foundation of Roebling’s backend is a no-code project simulation engine that combines aspects of chemical engineering, finance, and operations with AI-enabled workflows to inform infrastructure investment decisions for industrial projects with construction budgets from $10s to $100s of millions. If you're motivated by using software and AI to unlock physical infrastructure, we’d love to chat! Role Description – Senior/Staff Software Engineer As one of the earliest engineers at Roebling, you’ll help take the product from a working MVP to a robust, extensible, enterprise-grade platform used by engineering and operations teams on real industrial projects. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys taking ideas from 0→1, and is comfortable working across the stack—from backend services and data pipelines to simulation infrastructure and frontend architecture. You’ll collaborate closely with the founders and early customers, shaping not only the technical architecture but also the engineering culture, product direction, and standards we’ll scale with. Some days you’ll be rapidly prototyping new workflows for user feedback; other days you’ll be designing core systems that must be correct, performant, and maintainable for years. We’re looking for engineers who are energized by building foundational systems, owning large pieces of the product, and solving hard problems that blend AI, industrial modeling, and complex data flows. Example projects you might work on: • Designing an AI agent that explores a project’s design space by running thousands of simulation scenarios in parallel, evaluating tradeoffs to CAPEX/OPEX, throughput, and carbon intensity. • Building ingestion pipelines to bring public utility data, equipment specifications, and financial datasets into our data warehouse. • Optimizing the simulation engine for speed and stability, including algorithmic improvements and hardware acceleration. • Setting up CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, testing frameworks, and other systems that help our team move faster. Competencies Must-have • Strong proficiency in Python and TypeScript/React, with the ability to build new features that span the entire stack. • Thoughtful approach to system architecture and software design, with a track record of making pragmatic decisions in ambiguous environments. • Experience shipping production software at an early-stage startup, ideally owning projects end-to-end from design through deployment. • Clear written and verbal communicator, able to distill complex ideas, align the team on design decisions, and document your work. • High level of ownership and bias toward action—you default to making progress, unblocking yourself, and moving things forward. • Authorization to work in the United States. Nice-to-have • Experience with our specific stack: • Frontend: React, Next.js, Redux, TailwindCSS, Vercel • Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Pydantic, Supabase, Lang[chain|graph] • Practical experience building applications with LLMs • Hands-on experience with machine learning (e.g PyTorch) • Background or interest in scientific, mathematical, or engineering domains (e.g., biology, chemistry, physics, mechanical/chemical engineering). • Degree in Computer Science, or a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures Other While fully-remote, our team highly values in-person collaboration. We have a preference for candidates near our existing team (NYC, SF/Bay Area, Boston) who are open to hybrid work. Compensation Salary range: $140-200k, based on experience Our team aspires to hire great people and create an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. It's an exciting time to join Roebling and build that environment from the ground up! Benefits Include • Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage • Daily lunch allowance • Coworking space (NYC, Boston, SF Bay Area) • Competitive compensation packages, including equity • Flexible PTO • 401(k) • Team offsites Roebling provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

If you’re passionate about building productized AI experiences—fast, reliable, and deeply usable—we want to talk. WHAT YOU'LL DO As an AI Product Engineer, you’ll work across product and infrastructure layers to ship developer-facing AI features that feel like magic—intelligent, fast, and deeply embedded into the act of building software. You might: • Build generative UIs that let users create real apps from natural language • Improve the performance, observability, and safety of our internal model architecture • Extend our AI evaluation systems to support smarter ranking, feedback loops, and product metrics • Develop patterns for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting, and agentic architecture. • Contribute to building internal tools that help us accelerate iteration on AI features and workflows You’ll work in a TypeScript + Node.js + React stack, but we value strong engineering fundamentals over specific frameworks.
