    "description": "Senior Software Engineer - AI-Enhanced Development Lead\n\nLocation: United States\n\nNo visa sponsorship is available for this position.\n\nWe are looking for a senior level Software Engineer who will champion the use of Artificial Intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle. In this role you will help guide a globally distributed development team in leveraging AI driven tools and techniques to accelerate design, coding, testing, deployment, and operations while preserving the rigor required for a highly regulated, mission critical financial services platform for higher education.\n\nYou will work on a large, mature enterprise backend that powers student financial aid management for universities in the United States. The system runs in a strict regulatory environment and has deep, complex business logic. Your mission is to modernize the way we build and sustain this platform by introducing AI assisted practices that add real, measurable value—speed, quality, compliance, and maintainability—without compromising safety or reliability.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\n• Help define a roadmap for AI adoption across all phases of the software lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, observability, incident response).\n\n• Evaluate, pilot, and scale AI enabled tools (e.g., large language model code assistants, test case generation, performance tuning bots, security analysis agents).\n\n• Help set policies and guardrails for responsible AI usage.\n\n• Design and extend core services using Java 17+, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Helidon.\n\n• Refactor legacy components to be AI friendly (e.g., adding rich documentation, type safe APIs, modular boundaries).\n\n• Help the team in integrating AI assisted IDE extensions, pair programming bots, and code review assistants.\n\n• Assist with establishing best practice guidelines for when and how to rely on AI generated code, ensuring human validation and auditability.\n\n• Deploy AI driven test case generation, mutation testing, and automated exploratory testing.\n\n• Use AI to predict flaky tests, prioritize test execution, and automatically generate test data sets.\n\n• Incorporate AI powered pipeline optimizations (e.g., smart build caching, failure root cause analysis, deployment risk scoring).\n\n• Automate intelligent rollback decisions and anomaly detection using observability AI.\n\n• Foster a data driven, continuous learning culture where AI is seen as a collaborative teammate, not a replacement.\n\n• Work with Oracle Security teams to guarantee AI tooling respects data privacy, regulatory, and security constraints.\n\n• Conduct regular AI risk assessments and integrate findings into the software security assurance process.\n\n• Communicate effectively with product owners, architects, and senior stakeholders across time zones (Slack, Zoom, async docs).\n\n• Participate in Kanban ceremonies, code reviews, and architecture boards, bringing AI centric perspectives to each.\n\nCore Stack & Environment\n\nLanguages & Frameworks: Java 17+, Spring Framework & Spring Boot, Hibernate, Helidon (plus exposure to emerging AI centric frameworks)\n\nContainers & Orchestration: Kubernetes (Helm, Operators)\n\nDatabases: Oracle, MySQL (AI assisted query tuning, automated schema evolution)\n\nBuild & Tooling: Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Jenkins (AI enhanced pipelines)\n\nTesting: JUnit, Cucumber/BDD, AI generated test scaffolding, mutation testing tools\n\nCollaboration: Remote first, globally distributed team, async workflow, strong emphasis on documentation\n\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\n• Java Mastery | 7+ years of production Java development, deep knowledge of the Spring ecosystem.\n\n• AI Tooling Savvy\n\n• Proven experience experimenting with LLM based code assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Claude, or internal Oracle AI tools).\n\n• Experience can be from personal projects, POCs, or enterprise pilots.\n\n• Systems Thinking\n\n• Ability to navigate large, legacy codebases and design modular, AI compatible components.\n\n• Regulated Domain Acumen\n\n• Familiarity with compliance heavy environments (e.g., FERPA, GDPR, financial data handling).\n\n• Leadership & Influence\n\n• Demonstrated mentorship, evangelism, and the ability to drive cross team adoption of new practices.\n\n• Strong Communication\n\n• Clear, concise English (written and spoken); capable of influencing senior stakeholders and remote teams.\n\n• Automation & DevOps\n\n• Experience with CI/CD pipelines; enthusiasm for AI driven automation in build, test, and release stages.\n\n• Quality Mindset\n\n• Passion for automated testing, code quality, and continuous improvement.\n\n• Curiosity & Pragmatism | Willingness to experiment with emerging AI tech but also the discipline to reject it when the ROI isn’t clear.\n\n• Formal AI expertise (e.g., ML research, data science) is not required—what matters is the ability to evaluate, adopt, and champion AI tools responsibly.\n\nIf you’re a seasoned Java engineer who is excited about helping to lead the AI transformation of a mission critical enterprise platform—and you thrive in a collaborative, remote first environment—this is the role for you. Bring your engineering depth, curiosity, and pragmatic AI mindset, and help us set a new standard for intelligent software development.",

    "description": "At Mechanical Orchard, we specialize in safely rewriting the most critical and complex business applications—the software that runs the world as we know it today—so they’re ready to adapt quickly and easily to market challenges and opportunities. Our approach emerged from observing the decades-long failure patterns in modernization efforts and is designed to eliminate the risks and disruptions that characterize most projects.\n\nOur background in software development and the impact on the industry is well known: we've literally helped write the book on XP and other impactful Agile practices. We’re applying the same thoughtfulness and rigor in applying AI pragmatically where it helps. We believe in the durable principles behind Agile, and embrace the power of cross-functional teams, collective ownership, test driven development, short feedback loops, and continuous improvement.\n\nWe’re bringing joy to beleaguered IT teams everywhere. Together, we’re seeing how applying craft, expertise, and technologies we’re building can fundamentally transform the way companies operate, innovate, and win. Our values are: Do the right thing. Do what works. Be kind.\n\nAs a Software Engineer at Mechanical Orchard, you will be expected to:\n\n- Work as part of small, cross functional XP teams building production applications for customers or for Mechanical Orchard using a variety of modern programming languages\n\n- Pair program with other engineers and collaborate closely with other roles such as product managers and designers\n\n- Apply and evolve XP engineering practices such pair programming, test-driven development, refactoring, continuous integration and continuous delivery\n\n- Operate and support production applications as a team in the context of the agile DevSecOps model\n\n- Help onboard developers (internal and external) to practices and techniques\n\n- Lead and collaborate on technical discovery efforts for existing systems, particularly legacy mainframes\n\n- Continuously learn about relevant emerging AI or traditional technologies and agile practices\n\n- Foster the growth of the organization through mentorship, tech talks, and other means\n\n- Support and improve our system stability including through on-call rotations\n\nThings to consider before applying\n\n- Our technology org has an on-call rotation which is essential to the maintenance of the modern systems we build. If that’s not something you want to commit to, you might be frustrated here.\n\n- If you dislike or have never tried pair programming, expect a steep learning curve.\n\n- If you need an in-office experience (and don’t live near our headquarters in San Francisco), MO might not be the best fit.\n\n- We offer opportunities for team and organization offsites. If you want zero travel for work, you may feel left out.\n\n- A lot of our teams have a customer-facing services component. It may be difficult to fully avoid that kind of work over time.\n\n- Most of the mainframe systems we work with have COBOL, which has a steep learning curve and many foreign concepts.\n\nThe ideal candidate has worked as a software engineer in a professional, team based environment, with some exposure or demonstrated passion for XP practices such as pair programming and test driven development.\n\nThey are comfortable as a full stack developer, and have expertise in at least one modern programming language and application framework. Our tech stack includes Java, Python, Elixir, Rust, Go, and Nix. If you don’t know any of these, that's fine.\n\nStrong communication and collaboration skills as well as empathy are essential for working closely with the development team, customers, and others at Mechanical Orchard.\n\nPlease Note: The appropriate role level and compensation will be determined at the time of offer, following completion of the full interview process, based on an assessment of the candidate’s qualifications, experience, and demonstrated skills.\n\nMechanical Orchard, Inc. is an Equal Opportunity Employer and Prohibits Discrimination and Harassment of Any Kind. Mechanical Orchard, Inc. is committed to the principle of equal employment opportunity for all employees and to providing employees with a work environment free of discrimination and harassment. All employment decisions at Mechanical Orchard, Inc. are based on business needs, job requirements and individual qualifications, without regard to race, color, religion or belief, national, social or ethnic origin, sex (including pregnancy), age, physical, mental or sensory disability, HIV Status, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, marital, civil union or domestic partnership status, past or present military service, family medical history or genetic information, family or parental status, or any other status protected by the laws or regulations in the locations where we operate. Mechanical Orchard, Inc. will not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on any of these characteristics. Mechanical Orchard, Inc. encourages applicants of all ages. Mechanical Orchard, Inc. will provide reasonable accommodation to employees who have protected disabilities consistent with local law.\n\nWe look forward to reviewing your application. Thanks!",

We are a small, product-obsessed team of engineers and researchers who are passionate about solving hard problems. This is a ground-floor opportunity to shape the core architecture and product direction of a company poised to redefine its category. The Role: Software Engineer (Golang & LLM Focus) We are seeking a versatile and driven Software Engineer with deep expertise in Golang and a strong interest in Large Language Models (LLMs). You will be a foundational member of the engineering team, directly responsible for designing, building, and scaling the core backend systems that power our AI-driven platform. Your work will sit at the critical intersection of high-performance data processing, API design, and the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs into a robust, production-grade environment. This role is for someone who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys taking ownership of complex features from concept to deployment, and is excited to write code that will form the bedrock of our company. Key Responsibilities Design, develop, and maintain high-performance, distributed backend services in Golang. Architect and implement robust APIs and data pipelines for processing and serving data to and from our LLM-based inference systems. Integrate with various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and open-source models, optimizing for latency, cost, and reliability. Contribute to the entire software development lifecycle, including concept, design, build, deployment, and operational excellence. Collaborate closely with ML researchers and engineers to productionize machine learning models and algorithms. Write clean, well-tested, and maintainable code, and participate in rigorous code reviews. Proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks, scalability challenges, and system vulnerabilities. Qualifications & Experience Must-Haves: 3+ years of professional software development experience with a strong focus on backend systems. Proven, hands-on experience building and shipping production-level services in Golang. Solid understanding of computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, and system design. Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes). A genuine passion for and understanding of the modern AI/ML landscape, specifically Large Language Models. Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently in a fast-paced, early-stage startup environment. Nice-to-Haves: Hands-on experience fine-tuning, deploying, or managing open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama, Mistral). Experience with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures. Knowledge of MLOps practices and tools for model deployment and monitoring. Familiarity with data engineering and processing large-scale, unstructured datasets. Previous experience in an early-stage, venture-backed startup. What We Offer Foundational Impact: Your code and architectural decisions will have an outsized impact on the product and the company's trajectory. Equity Ownership: A significant equity grant, ensuring you share directly in the value you create. Competitive Compensation: A competitive salary and benefits package, reflective of our recent funding. Cutting-Edge Tech Stack: The opportunity to work exclusively with modern technologies on challenging, green-field projects. A-Player Team: Collaborate with a small, dedicated, and highly skilled team that values learning and excellence. To Apply Please submit your resume and a brief note explaining your interest in this specific role, highlighting a relevant project involving Golang and/or LLMs. We are moving quickly and are excited to meet our next foundational team member.

Our talented team is at the forefront in Security Engineering, Computer Network Operations (CNO), Mission Software, Analytical Methods and Modeling, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Cryptographic Key Management. At Leidos, we offer competitive benefits, including Paid Time Off, 11 paid Holidays, 401K with a 6% company match and immediate vesting, Flexible Schedules, Discounted Stock Purchase Plans, Technical Upskilling, Education and Training Support, Parental Paid Leave, and much more. Join us and make a difference in National Security!\n\nThis position is eligible for a sign on bonus of 💰$25,000.\n\nLeidos is seeking a driven and experienced Software Engineer to support a high‑stakes, mission‑critical program. In this role, you’ll architect, develop, and integrate advanced AI/ML solutions that shape national security and drive meaningful innovation. Join an Agile team where your expertise won’t just be valued—it will be vital.\n\nPrimary Responsibilities\n• Design, develop, integrate and enhance secure AI/ML applications and systems in support of evolving operational environments\n• Implement and optimize complex algorithms, including deep learning models\n• Debug and optimize software for performance and reliability\n• Collaborate in Agile Scrum teams to deliver rapid, high‑quality releases\n• Create and maintain system documentation and technical reports\n\nBasic Qualifications\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related discipline (or 4 additional years of experience in lieu of degree)\n• 14+ years of software engineering experience supporting programs of similar type and scope\n• Proficiency in Python and modern programming languages\n• Clearance Requirement: Active TS/SCI clearance with Polygraph\n\nDesired Qualifications\n• AWS experience experience implementing production‑scale AI/ML systems\n• Experience with Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud infrastructure management\n• Knowledge of AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face)\n• Familiarity with generative AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok)\n\nCONMD\nCSSRC\n\nAt Leidos, we don’t want someone who \"fits the mold\"—we want someone who melts it down and builds something better. This is a role for the restless, the over-caffeinated, the ones who ask, “what’s next?” before the dust settles on “what’s now.”\n\nIf you’re already scheming step 20 while everyone else is still debating step 2… good. You’ll fit right in.\n\nOriginal Posting:\nDecember 17, 2025\n\nFor U.S. Positions: While subject to change based on business needs, Leidos reasonably anticipates that this job requisition will remain open for at least 3 days with an anticipated close date of no earlier than 3 days after the original posting date as listed above.\n\nPay Range:\nPay Range $131,300.00 - $237,350.00\n\nThe Leidos pay range for this job level is a general guideline only and not a guarantee of compensation or salary. Additional factors considered in extending an offer include (but are not limited to) responsibilities of the job, education, experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as internal equity, alignment with market data, applicable bargaining agreement (if any), or other law.\n\nAbout Leidos\n\nLeidos is an industry and technology leader serving government and commercial customers with smarter, more efficient digital and mission innovations. Headquartered in Reston, Virginia, with 47,000 global employees, Leidos reported annual revenues of approximately $16.7 billion for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2025. For more information, visit www.Leidos.com.\n\nPay and Benefits\n\nPay and benefits are fundamental to any career decision. That's why we craft compensation packages that reflect the importance of the work we do for our customers. Employment benefits include competitive compensation, Health and Wellness programs, Income Protection, Paid Leave and Retirement. More details are available at www.leidos.com/careers/pay-benefits.\n\nSecuring Your Data\n\nBeware of fake employment opportunities using Leidos’ name. Leidos will never ask you to provide payment-related information during any part of the employment application process (i.e., ask you for money), nor will Leidos ever advance money as part of the hiring process (i.e., send you a check or money order before doing any work). Further, Leidos will only communicate with you through emails that are generated by the Leidos.com automated system – never from free commercial services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail) or via WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. If you received an email purporting to be from Leidos that asks for payment-related information or any other personal information (e.g., about you or your previous employer), and you are concerned about its legitimacy, please make us aware immediately by emailing us at LeidosCareersFraud@leidos.com.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of a scam, contact your local law enforcement and report the incident to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nCommitment to Non-Discrimination\n\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to sex, race, ethnicity, age, national origin, citizenship, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, pregnancy, family structure, marital status, ancestry, domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran or military status, or any other basis prohibited by law.

    "description": "About Us\n\nWe’re building Roebling, an AI-native industrial planning platform aimed at enabling the rapid development of the industrial infrastructure required to power and manufacture cutting edge technologies. Today, innovators face an outdated reality: getting to construction on projects big and small requires thousands of hours of repetitive, PDF- and spreadsheet-driven workflows with heavy QA/QC overhead. It’s inefficient, slow, and largely unchanged for more than a century. Over the past 18 months, we’ve built an MVP to demonstrate how reducing planning timelines by 10x helps companies bring new products to market faster.\n\nWe’re not building another OpenAI wrapper – the foundation of Roebling’s backend is a no-code project simulation engine that combines aspects of chemical engineering, finance, and operations with AI-enabled workflows to inform infrastructure investment decisions for industrial projects with construction budgets from $10s to $100s of millions. If you're motivated by using software and AI to unlock physical infrastructure, we’d love to chat!\n\nRole Description – Senior/Staff Software Engineer\n\nAs one of the earliest engineers at Roebling, you’ll help take the product from a working MVP to a robust, extensible, enterprise-grade platform used by engineering and operations teams on real industrial projects. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys taking ideas from 0→1, and is comfortable working across the stack—from backend services and data pipelines to simulation infrastructure and frontend architecture.\n\nYou’ll collaborate closely with the founders and early customers, shaping not only the technical architecture but also the engineering culture, product direction, and standards we’ll scale with. Some days you’ll be rapidly prototyping new workflows for user feedback; other days you’ll be designing core systems that must be correct, performant, and maintainable for years.\n\nWe’re looking for engineers who are energized by building foundational systems, owning large pieces of the product, and solving hard problems that blend AI, industrial modeling, and complex data flows.\n\nExample projects you might work on:\n• Designing an AI agent that explores a project’s design space by running thousands of simulation scenarios in parallel, evaluating tradeoffs to CAPEX/OPEX, throughput, and carbon intensity.\n• Building ingestion pipelines to bring public utility data, equipment specifications, and financial datasets into our data warehouse.\n• Optimizing the simulation engine for speed and stability, including algorithmic improvements and hardware acceleration.\n• Setting up CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, testing frameworks, and other systems that help our team move faster.\n\nCompetencies\n\nMust-have\n• Strong proficiency in Python and TypeScript/React, with the ability to build new features that span the entire stack.\n• Thoughtful approach to system architecture and software design, with a track record of making pragmatic decisions in ambiguous environments.\n• Experience shipping production software at an early-stage startup, ideally owning projects end-to-end from design through deployment.\n• Clear written and verbal communicator, able to distill complex ideas, align the team on design decisions, and document your work.\n• High level of ownership and bias toward action—you default to making progress, unblocking yourself, and moving things forward.\n• Authorization to work in the United States.\n\nNice-to-have\n• Experience with our specific stack:\n• Frontend: React, Next.js, Redux, TailwindCSS, Vercel\n• Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Pydantic, Supabase, Lang[chain|graph]\n• Practical experience building applications with LLMs\n• Hands-on experience with machine learning (e.g PyTorch)\n• Background or interest in scientific, mathematical, or engineering domains (e.g., biology, chemistry, physics, mechanical/chemical engineering).\n• Degree in Computer Science, or a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures\n\nOther\n\nWhile fully-remote, our team highly values in-person collaboration. We have a preference for candidates near our existing team (NYC, SF/Bay Area, Boston) who are open to hybrid work.\n\nCompensation\n\nSalary range: $140-200k, based on experience\n\nOur team aspires to hire great people and create an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. It's an exciting time to join Roebling and build that environment from the ground up!\n\nBenefits Include\n• Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage\n• Daily lunch allowance\n• Coworking space (NYC, Boston, SF Bay Area)\n• Competitive compensation packages, including equity\n• Flexible PTO\n• 401(k)\n• Team offsites\n\nRoebling provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU\nRetool started by addressing obstacles with internal tools and has grown into a company that solves internal tooling for thousands of companies (big and small). Now, with AI-native capabilities, we’re going a step further: transforming how humans interact with software entirely.\nWe’re hiring AI Product Engineers to help us push the boundaries of what’s possible with LLMs in the hands of developers. If you’re passionate about building productized AI experiences—fast, reliable, and deeply usable—we want to talk.\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\nAs an AI Product Engineer, you’ll work across product and infrastructure layers to ship developer-facing AI features that feel like magic—intelligent, fast, and deeply embedded into the act of building software. You might:\n• Build generative UIs that let users create real apps from natural language\n• Improve the performance, observability, and safety of our internal model architecture\n• Extend our AI evaluation systems to support smarter ranking, feedback loops, and product metrics\n• Develop patterns for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting, and agentic architecture.\n• Contribute to building internal tools that help us accelerate iteration on AI features and workflows\n\nYou’ll work in a TypeScript + Node.js + React stack, but we value strong engineering fundamentals over specific frameworks. You should be comfortable navigating the full stack, even if you lean more frontend or backend.\n\nTHE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING\n• 3+ years of professional software engineering experience\n• A track record of building and shipping real product—not just models or papers\n• Experience working with LLMs and modern techniques (RAG, CoT, few-shot, embeddings, etc.)\n• An eye for product: you care how features work and how they feel\n• Familiarity with vector databases, prompt orchestration tools, and evaluation techniques\n• A pragmatic mindset about what’s scalable and maintainable in production\n• Strong opinions, weakly held—you move quickly but bring others along\n• Bonus: experience building AI features for developer tools or productivity software\n• WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH\nYou’ll join a small, fast-moving AI team inside Retool, working alongside engineers, designers, and PMs who’ve built everything from visual programming systems to compiler infrastructure. You’ll also collaborate with our core product and infra teams as we deepen AI’s role across the platform.\nWe value ownership, speed, and a tight feedback loop with our customers (many of whom are developers themselves). This is a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of AI, developer experience, and product design—with real users, real use cases, and real impact.\n\nNICE TO HAVE\n• Experience in JavaScript / TypeScript\n• Experience with PostgreSQL\n• Exposure to MLOps techniques (e.g., fine-tuning pipelines, model hosting)\n• Experience mentoring other engineers or working closely with design\n\nREADY TO BUILD THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE?\nIf you’re excited to shape how developers build with AI—from prompts to production—we’d love to meet you.",

We’re explorers, pursuing society’s most critical safety and justice issues with our ecosystem of devices and cloud software. Like our products, we work better together. We connect with candor and care, seeking out diverse perspectives from our customers, communities and each other.\n\nLife at Axon is fast-paced, challenging and meaningful. Here, you’ll take ownership and drive real change. Constantly grow as you work hard for a mission that matters at a company where you matter.\n\nAbout Prepared\n\nAs of October 1, 2025, Prepared has officially joined forces with Axon—a major milestone for both our team and the public safety community. United by a shared mission to Protect Life, Axon and Prepared are ushering in a new era of AI-powered emergency communications. Together, we’re closing the gap between the first call for help and resolution in the field—empowering responders with the clarity they need when every second counts.\n\n911 is the backbone of public safety in America. But for too long, the professionals answering our calls have been let down by outdated technology. Prepared exists to change that. Since launching in 2021, we’ve used cutting-edge AI to help streamline millions of emergency calls across 49 states—supporting over 90 million people and transforming what's possible in crisis response.\n\nAt Prepared, you’re not just joining a team—you’re helping shape the future of emergency services and building a safer, more connected world.\nPosition Overview\n\nWe are looking for an experienced platform engineer to join our platform engineering team.

This role requires a blend of strategic vision and hands-on technical skills.\n\nAs an early member of the team, you will also play a key role in shaping the foundation of Prepared’s engineering culture.\nKey Responsibilities\n• Design, build, and maintain scalable, reliable, and secure infrastructure to support Prepared’s platform.\n• Architect, implement, and iterate on core systems like authentication, authorization, feature flags, and asynchronous messaging.\n• Develop and implement best practices for software development, deployment, and monitoring.\n• Automate repetitive tasks to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the engineering team.\n• Help the team implement and define SLOs and report on customer SLAs.\n• Participate in architectural discussions and contribute to the long-term strategy of the platform.\n• Mentor junior engineers and help shape the engineering culture within the team.\nWhat Makes You a Great Fit\n• 5+ years of software engineering industry experience.\n• Proven capacity to operate in a platform engineering or similar role.\n• Experience with large-scale distributed systems.\n• Desire to work in a fast-paced and dynamic startup environment.\n• Strong knowledge of cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.\n• Working knowledge of infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or Crossplane.\n• Experience with containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.\n• Solid understanding of CI/CD pipelines and tools like Github Actions, Drone CI, or Gitlab CI.\n• Proficiency in or eagerness to learn our backend stack (RoR, Go).\n• Familiarity with monitoring and logging tools and standards such as OpenTelemetry, Datadog, and the LGTM stack.\n• Strong communication skills and a love for both producing and consuming documentation.\nBonus\n• Experience in an early-stage startup.\n• Knowledge of security and compliance best practices and experience implementing them in a fast-moving environment.\n• Expertise in Ruby on Rails, Golang, and/or IaC tools.\nBenefits that Benefit You\n• Competitive salary and 401k with employer match\n• Discretionary time off\n• Paid parental leave for all\n• Medical, Dental, Vision plans\n• Fitness Programs\n• Emotional & Development Programs\n• And yes, we have snacks in our offices\n\nThe Pay: Axon is a total compensation company, meaning compensation is made up of base pay, bonus, and stock awards. The starting base pay for this role is between USD 141,000 in the lowest geographic market and USD 225,600 in the highest geographic market. The actual base pay is dependent upon many factors, such as: level, function, training, transferable skills, work experience, business needs, geographic market, and often a combination of all these factors. Our benefits offer an array of options to help support you physically, financially and emotionally through the big milestones and in your everyday life. To see more details on our benefits offerings please visit www.axon.com/careers/benefits\n\nDon’t meet every single requirement? That's ok. At Axon, we Aim Far. We think big with a long-term view because we want to reinvent the world to be a safer, better place. We are also committed to building diverse teams that reflect the communities we serve.\n\nStudies have shown that women and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they check every box in the job description. If you’re excited about this role and our mission to Protect Life but your experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification listed here, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.\n\nImportant Notes\n\nThe above job description is not intended as, nor should it be construed as, exhaustive of all duties, responsibilities, skills, efforts, or working conditions associated with this job. The job description may change or be supplemented at any time in accordance with business needs and conditions.\n\nSome roles may also require legal eligibility to work in a firearms environment.\n\nAxon’s mission is to Protect Life and is committed to the well-being and safety of its employees as well as Axon’s impact on the environment. All Axon employees must be aware of and committed to the appropriate environmental, health, and safety regulations, policies, and procedures. Axon employees are empowered to report safety concerns as they arise and activities potentially impacting the environment.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer that promotes justice, advances equity, values diversity and fosters inclusion. We’re committed to hiring the best talent — regardless of race, creed, color, ancestry, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship status, marital status, disability, gender identity, genetic information, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws, regulations and ordinances — and empowering all of our employees so they can do their best work.

The provided salary depends on many factors, such as work experience and transferable skills, business needs and impact, location, and market demands.\n\nAt Render, we’re building the modern cloud platform for developers creating AI-native, full-stack, multi-service applications. Our mission is to eliminate the tradeoff between the power of hyperscalers and the simplicity of developer-friendly platforms—so teams can ship fast, scale reliably, and focus on their product, not infrastructure.\n\nUnlike complex hyperscalers or ephemeral edge/serverless solutions, Render offers a developer-first experience with persistent compute, dynamic autoscaling, built-in orchestration, and observability, allowing teams to launch, scale, and manage real-world applications without writing infrastructure code or managing servers. Whether you're building LLM-powered applications, scalable SaaS products, or async processing pipelines, Render empowers teams to move fast and scale confidently from MVP to millions of users.\n\nOur platform is trusted by over 3 million developers worldwide and continues to grow rapidly. In January 2025, we raised $80M in Series C financing, bringing our total funding to $157M, to accelerate our vision of making cloud infrastructure both powerful and intuitive—designed for the speed of modern AI development.\n\nWe’re a diverse and talented team that values craft, velocity, and user experience. If you’re excited to help shape the future of the intelligent cloud and empower developers everywhere, we’d love to hear from you.\n\nApplying to Render\n\nWe're seeking candidates who possess high integrity, humility, and an insatiable drive to learn. Through reasoned discussions and continuous feedback, we strive to improve both individually and collectively.

    "description": "Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with over 300 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nAbout the Team\n\nNetflix's Workforce Security team protects its employees, endpoints, and vendors by implementing controls for secure user access, SaaS and vendor usage, and endpoint security. The goal is to address security risks while pragmatically allowing business agility, leveraging risk-based approaches over policy mandates, and building strong cross-functional partnerships across the company.\n\nAbout the role\n\nWe seek a talented L5 Security Software Engineer to join our team and help drive the development of scalable technical security controls that enhance business agility and reduce risk at Netflix across various workforce-related security areas.\n\nIn this role, exposure to and understanding of workforce security concerns and related mitigations drive scalable controls work. You will help enumerate risks and associated controls and derive technical security requirements. You must be able to clearly identify the problem and why it matters, decompose the solution, and appropriately prioritize/size associated features.\n\nYou will uplift and extend internally developed security tools—e.g., GDrive access rightsizing, browser extension security, security posture, and metrics dashboards—by building new features, maintaining existing systems, and integrating with commercially available software where appropriate. You will be key in evaluating build vs. buy options for deploying the proper workforce security controls for Netflix’s needs.\n\nYou will ensure that the software developed is high-quality and meets functional and non-functional requirements. You should also be fluent in secure development practices so that security defects are not introduced into software. Collaboration is essential, as you will work closely with partner software development teams to integrate services and tools, and grow our team’s software development capabilities.\n\nThe ideal candidate delivers reliable, product-focused solutions for workforce security, especially in vendor security and security guidance, and is comfortable providing on-call support for security guidance, incident response, and critical outages.\n\nYou should have:\n• Knowledge of Workforce Security problems and solutions, and exposure to corporate security tooling in the areas of endpoint, identity, data, and vendor security\n• Experience building software in Node.js (JavaScript, TypeScript) and Python\n• Experience with cloud computing primitives\n• Strong full-stack development skills and a history of shaping end-to-end solutions\n• A drive to understand “why” first, to inform your approach decisions\n• Familiarity with overall system design and architecture, and how to progressively improve software\n• Data Engineering skills: Building Extract Transform Load (ETL) pipelines, data query language competency (SQL, Graphy Query Language, other DSL)\n• Using measurement and metrics to drive decision-making and outcomes\n• High-level understanding of security concerns\n• Competency in turning Threat Models into security requirements\n• Working experience with secure coding best practices\n\nYou will succeed in this role if you:\n• Believe a diverse and inclusive team is a critical aspect of a sustainable and effective work environment\n• Value a deeply collaborative team\n• Use data to inform your judgment, and to support and communicate your decisions\n• Empathize with your customers, and have an interest in the overall product lifecycle\n• Effectively communicate complex subjects to our internal customers and partners\n• Challenge the status quo and seek to find novel and customer-centric ways to solve problems\n• Enjoy taking full ownership of open-ended problems, from concept to product, and effectively managing your own time.\n• Care about improving the systems around you and leaving things better than you found them.\n\nOur compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $100,000 - $720,000.\n\nNetflix provides comprehensive benefits including Health Plans, Mental Health support, a 401(k) Retirement Plan with employer match, Stock Option Program, Disability Programs, Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts, Family-forming benefits, and Life and Serious Injury Benefits. We also offer paid leave of absence programs. Full-time hourly employees accrue 35 days annually for paid time off to be used for vacation, holidays, and sick paid time off. Full-time salaried employees are immediately entitled to flexible time off. See more detail about our Benefits here.\n\nNetflix is a unique culture and environment. Learn more here.\n\nInclusion is a Netflix value and we strive to host a meaningful interview experience for all candidates. If you want an accommodation/adjustment for a disability or any other reason during the hiring process, please send a request to your recruiting partner.\n\nWe are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, age, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic makeup, marital status, or military service.\n\nJob is open for no less than 7 days and will be removed when the position is filled.",

    "description": "Who is Flock?\n\nFlock Safety is the leading safety technology platform, helping communities thrive by taking a proactive approach to crime prevention and security. Our hardware and software suite connects cities, law enforcement, businesses, schools, and neighborhoods in a nationwide public-private safety network. Trusted by over 5,000 communities, 4,500 law enforcement agencies, and 1,000 businesses, Flock delivers real-time intelligence while prioritizing privacy and responsible innovation.\n\nWe’re a high-performance, low-ego team driven by urgency, collaboration, and bold thinking. Working at Flock means tackling big challenges, moving fast, and continuously improving. It’s intense but deeply rewarding for those who want to make an impact.\n\nWith nearly $700M in venture funding and a $7.5B valuation, we’re scaling intentionally and seeking top talent to help build the impossible. If you value teamwork, ownership, and solving tough problems, Flock could be the place for you.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nWith Flock's services undergoing exponential growth, we are seeking a seasoned Software Engineer to join the Insights and Analytics team. This team is critical for helping customers visualize their data and find actionable insights to maximize the value of their services within the Flock Software Platform. In this role, you will be responsible for building, maintaining, and scaling intuitive applications that enable efficient decision-making from the wealth of collected data and provide clear signals through the noise. This is a crucial time to join, as the Insights team owns the strategy for efficient data visualization and needs a strong engineer to collaborate, contribute to the product, and build stronger bindings to the overall platform to address the diverse and sophisticated technical challenges. We encourage continuous learning, provide plenty of growth opportunities, and value a fast-paced, decisive, and collaborative approach to iteration.\n\nThe Skillset\n• Love writing code and a commitment to continuous learning.\n• Motivated by taking an unknown problem, sinking your teeth in, and coming up with a plan of attack (resourceful problem-solver mindset).\n• Desire to grow your role and directly influence the growth of a young company.\n• Excited about working on a fast-paced, constantly evolving product.\n• Confidence with TypeScript / Node / Express for web services and strong general API design skills (e.g., REST, gRPC, GraphQL, etc).\n• Confidence in a modern web framework like React / Typescript. (Would love to talk if that is really Vue or Angular too, ideally, you understand the patterns and differences with a good familiarity and strong in Typescript).\n• Strong familiarity with relational databases, we primarily use PostgreSQL, but this role will likely interact with Clickhouse and other databases as well.\n• Confidence with sophisticated SQL to access and synthesize customer data especially for reporting summaries and visualizations. (More important than specific reporting tools like Superset or Quicksight).\n• Experience with graphing and/or visualization libraries (like D3.js, ECharts, Chart.js, etc).\n• Confidence in microservices and system design.\n• Familiar with Docker and how to run locally and deploy remotely via Helm to Kubernetes.\n• Familiar with AWS and have used some managed services like S3, API Gateway, SNS/SQS, etc.\n• Familiarity with Terraform or similar IaC patterns.\n\nFeeling uneasy that you haven’t ticked every box? That’s okay; we’ve felt that way too. Studies have shown women and minorities are less likely to apply unless they meet all qualifications. We encourage you to break the status quo and apply to roles that would make you excited to come to work every day.\n\n90 Days at Flock\n\nWe prescribe to 90 day plans and believe that good days, lead to good weeks, which lead to good months. The purpose of a 90 day plan: At Flock, we believe strongly in setting clear expectations and holding ourselves accountable. These are detailed outlines of what success looks like for an individual and are the best tools to establish regular feedback with a new manager-direct report relationship.\n\nThe First 30 Days\n• Meet with colleagues!\n• Meet with colleagues and key stakeholders to build relationships inside and outside the Insights team.\n• Familiarize yourself with the company's mission, products, and development processes (the Flock Way).\n• Pair with team members and adjacent teams to learn current practices and codebase.\n• Work on tasks for the sprint with support, participating in all scrum ceremonies.\n• Complete a first day push to production and start shipping code on a consistent basis with assistance.\n• Review teammates' code with an eye towards learning and offering your unique perspective.\n• Consistently bring agenda items to your weekly manager 1-1 meeting.\n\nThe First 60 Days\n• Ability to perform role with decreased need for guidance on routine tasks.\n• Able to complete larger features spanning multiple repositories with less assistance.\n• Understand the software design philosophies being used, especially around data visualization and microservices.\n• Learn the details of our deployment, monitoring, and logging stacks, and suggest improvements to observability.\n• Prioritize reviewing PRs to learn existing patterns and push peers to use stronger practices.\n• Establish a habit of running code locally when reviewing high-impact PRs.\n• Collaborate with cross-functional teams and build relationships with team members.\n• Help teach a skill or introduce a new development practice with your teammates.\n\n90 Days & Beyond\n• Ability to perform role with little guidance with transparency.\n• Be comfortable picking up engineering tasks of larger size and more ambiguity.\n• Demonstrate impact to teams outside Insights by representing the team on a cross-functional project and delivering needed solutions.\n• Author an architecture document for a major new feature, or review multiple architecture docs and push for strong patterns.\n• Lead our team in improving software quality and propose a solution to an observed user experience problem.\n• Communicate across multiple teams to solve problems efficiently.\n• Participate in one or more customer calls and complete a device installation ride-along.\n• Present recent work in a video demo to be shared with other teams.\n• Have a sense of where you want to grow at Flock.\n\nThe Interview Process\n\nWe want our interview process to be a true reflection of our culture: transparent and collaborative.
