We are looking for a senior level Software Engineer who will champion the use of Artificial Intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle. In this role you will help guide a globally distributed development team in leveraging AI driven tools and techniques to accelerate design, coding, testing, deployment, and operations while preserving the rigor required for a highly regulated, mission critical financial services platform for higher education. You will work on a large, mature enterprise backend that powers student financial aid management for universities in the United States. The system runs in a strict regulatory environment and has deep, complex business logic. Your mission is to modernize the way we build and sustain this platform by introducing AI assisted practices that add real, measurable value—speed, quality, compliance, and maintainability—without compromising safety or reliability. What You’ll Do • Help define a roadmap for AI adoption across all phases of the software lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, observability, incident response). • Evaluate, pilot, and scale AI enabled tools (e.g., large language model code assistants, test case generation, performance tuning bots, security analysis agents). • Help set policies and guardrails for responsible AI usage. • Design and extend core services using Java 17+, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Helidon. • Refactor legacy components to be AI friendly (e.g., adding rich documentation, type safe APIs, modular boundaries). • Help the team in integrating AI assisted IDE extensions, pair programming bots, and code review assistants. • Assist with establishing best practice guidelines for when and how to rely on AI generated code, ensuring human validation and auditability. • Deploy AI driven test case generation, mutation testing, and automated exploratory testing. • Use AI to predict flaky tests, prioritize test execution, and automatically generate test data sets. • Incorporate AI powered pipeline optimizations (e.g., smart build caching, failure root cause analysis, deployment risk scoring). • Automate intelligent rollback decisions and anomaly detection using observability AI. • Foster a data driven, continuous learning culture where AI is seen as a collaborative teammate, not a replacement. • Work with Oracle Security teams to guarantee AI tooling respects data privacy, regulatory, and security constraints. • Conduct regular AI risk assessments and integrate findings into the software security assurance process. • Communicate effectively with product owners, architects, and senior stakeholders across time zones (Slack, Zoom, async docs). • Participate in Kanban ceremonies, code reviews, and architecture boards, bringing AI centric perspectives to each. Core Stack & Environment Languages & Frameworks: Java 17+, Spring Framework & Spring Boot, Hibernate, Helidon (plus exposure to emerging AI centric frameworks) Containers & Orchestration: Kubernetes (Helm, Operators) Databases: Oracle, MySQL (AI assisted query tuning, automated schema evolution) Build & Tooling: Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Jenkins (AI enhanced pipelines) Testing: JUnit, Cucumber/BDD, AI generated test scaffolding, mutation testing tools Collaboration: Remote first, globally distributed team, async workflow, strong emphasis on documentation What We’re Looking For • Java Mastery | 7+ years of production Java development, deep knowledge of the Spring ecosystem. • AI Tooling Savvy • Proven experience experimenting with LLM based code assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Claude, or internal Oracle AI tools). • Experience can be from personal projects, POCs, or enterprise pilots. • Systems Thinking • Ability to navigate large, legacy codebases and design modular, AI compatible components. • Regulated Domain Acumen • Familiarity with compliance heavy environments (e.g., FERPA, GDPR, financial data handling). • Leadership & Influence • Demonstrated mentorship, evangelism, and the ability to drive cross team adoption of new practices. • Strong Communication • Clear, concise English (written and spoken); capable of influencing senior stakeholders and remote teams. • Automation & DevOps • Experience with CI/CD pipelines; enthusiasm for AI driven automation in build, test, and release stages. • Quality Mindset • Passion for automated testing, code quality, and continuous improvement. • Curiosity & Pragmatism | Willingness to experiment with emerging AI tech but also the discipline to reject it when the ROI isn’t clear. • Formal AI expertise (e.g., ML research, data science) is not required—what matters is the ability to evaluate, adopt, and champion AI tools responsibly. If you’re a seasoned Java engineer who is excited about helping to lead the AI transformation of a mission critical enterprise platform—and you thrive in a collaborative, remote first environment—this is the role for you.
